### Analysis


## Demultiplexing

To generate the subject cell labels, we used 23andMe genome files to demultiplex
the cells in each sample.

First, we convert the 23andMe files to VCF using 23andme2vcf. We created the VCF
against the manually curated 23andMe references, using the v4 reference
```
perl 23andme2vcf.pl S1_v4_Full.txt S1.vcf 4
```

Next, we compress and index the VCFs:
```
bgzip S1.vcf; tabix -p vcf S1.vcf.gz
```

And we use vcftools' vcf-merge to merge them into a single VCF file:
(we provide a custom column headers file, headers.txt, to give proper subject
column names)
```
vcf-merge S1.vcf.gz S2.vcf.gz S3.vcf.gz S4.vcf.gz -H "headers.txt" > capblood_seq_poc.vcf
```

Next we remove 'chr' from the beginning of each line:
```
sed -i 's/^chr//' capblood_seq_poc.vcf
```

And then sort the entries lexicographically: (thank you https://www.biostars.org/p/133487/#133489)

```
grep '^#' capblood_seq_poc.vcf > capblood_seq_poc_sorted.vcf && grep -v '^#' capblood_seq_poc.vcf | LC_ALL=C sort -t $'\t' -k1,1 -k2,2n >> capblood_seq_poc_sorted.vcf
```

And finally compress the new combined VCF:
```
bgzip capblood_seq_poc_sorted.vcf
```

We can then use this to generate a cell barcode label file using demuxlet
for each sample. This requires the raw possorted_genome_bam.bam file from
running the 10X Cell Ranger pipeline

```
demuxlet --sam possorted_genome_bam.bam --tag-group CB --tag-UMI UB --vcf capblood_seq_poc_sorted.vcf.gz --out demuxed --field GT
```

## Preprocessing

After receiving the output from 10X Cell Ranger, we convert the data into
SCRAP workspaces for downstream manipulation. An example of this is in
 ```Initialize Datasets.ipynb```.
 
 Then, we preprocess the data through several steps, an example of which is in
 ```Preprocessing.ipynb```
 1. Filter out any remaining debris, empty droplets, and red blood cells. This
 is done by a function in scrapi, but a step by step example is in 
 ```Debris Removal.ipynb```
 2. Remove low count genes (any genes that have a maximum count < 3)
 3. Convert gene counts into transcripts per cell
 4. (For visualization only) Transform the normalized gene counts via PCA, and
 then t-SNE
 
 ## Cell Subject Assignment
 
 After a workspace is created and filtered for debris, and demuxlet has
 assigned cells to subjects, we add it to our workspace label files. An example
 of this is in ```Assign Cells to Subject IDs.ipynb```
